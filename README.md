# Autoproj::CI


## Installation

Run

~~~
autoproj plugin install autoproj-ci
~~~

From within an autoproj workspace

## Usage

### Build cache

The `autoproj ci cache-push` and `autoproj ci cache-pull` subcommands allow you
to save build artifacts (push) or get them from the cache (pull) to avoid
re-building things that are not needed. The pull must be done after a
successful bootstrap and checkout of the workspace. The push after a build.
`cache-push` will automatically ignore packages whose build have failed,
**from the last build**. So, make sure to run it after a complete build.

`cache-pull` generates a JSON file that can be used to determine what has been
pulled from the cache. Cached packages can then be provided to the `--not` option
of `autoproj build`, as e.g.

~~~
autoproj build --not this_package that_package
~~~

Passing the options must be done by your build environment. It's not automatically
handled by the tools

## Development

Install the plugin with a `--path` option to use your working checkout

~~~
autoproj plugin install autoproj-ci --path /path/to/checkout
~~~
