# Autoproj::CI


## Installation

Run

~~~
autoproj plugin install autoproj-ci
~~~

From within an autoproj workspace

## Usage

### Build cache

The `autoproj ci cache-push`, `autoproj ci build` and `autoproj ci
cache-pull` subcommands allow you to save build artifacts (push) or get them
from the cache (pull and build) to avoid re-building things that are not
needed. The pull may be used to unarchive the relevant artifacts from the
archive dir into the workspace's prefix. `build` does `cache-pull` and
triggers a build that will ignore the cached packages. `cache-push` updates
the cache using the packages successfully build by the last build command.

`cache-pull` generates a JSON file that can be used to determine what has been
pulled from the cache. Cached packages can then be provided to the `--not` option
of `autoproj build`, as e.g.

~~~
autoproj build --not this_package that_package
~~~

Passing the options must be done by your build environment. It's not automatically
handled by the tools

## Development

Install the plugin with a `--path` option to use your working checkout

~~~
autoproj plugin install autoproj-ci --path /path/to/checkout
~~~
